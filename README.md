# More Math rpn
play around with More-Math without programming in JS.
Using a simple interface, do complex calculations without going to multiple sites!  
[Try it out!](https://erikhaag.github.io/More-Math-rpn/)

## How it works
In RPN (Reverse Polish Notation), values are on a stack and operations act and modify the top of the stack.
Because of this, the system can have any operation ordering **without** paratheses!

### examples
1. (10 + 5) * 3 -> 10 5 + 3 *
1. 10 + (5 * 3) -> 10 5 3 * +

## Copying
I implore you to improve my code, especially More-Math. I'd love to here about your explorations with my program!
